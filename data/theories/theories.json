Founded at Sri Aurobindo Ashram and Auroville, it emphasizes inner development, concentration, self-discovery, and connecting individual growth to universal consciousness.",

The model includes six teaching methods: modeling (expert demonstrates thinking aloud), coaching (feedback on learner performance), scaffolding (supports removed as competence grows), articulation (learners verbalize knowledge), reflection (comparing own processes to experts), and exploration (independent problem-solving).

The theory focuses on HOW people reason about moral dilemmas rather than specific moral conclusions. Kohlberg used the famous Heinz dilemma and similar scenarios to assess moral reasoning stages. The theory holds that stages are universal, sequential, and hierarchical—people cannot skip stages and rarely regress. Justice operations (equality and reciprocity) drive progress toward higher stages.",

Later additions include Cognitive needs (knowledge, meaning), Aesthetic needs (beauty, balance), and Transcendence (altruism, spirituality). 'Deficiency needs' (lower four) motivate through deprivation; 'growth needs' motivate through desire for betterment.

Key assessments include the Sally-Anne false-belief task, where children must recognize that others can hold beliefs that differ from reality. ToM typically develops between ages 3-5, following a sequence: diverse desires, diverse beliefs, knowledge access, false beliefs, and hidden emotions.

      "description": "Waldorf Education, developed by Rudolf Steiner in 1919 based on anthroposophy, is a holistic educational philosophy that addresses the intellectual, artistic, and practical development of pupils. The first school opened in Stuttgart, Germany for children of Waldorf-Astoria cigarette factory workers. The approach follows three seven-year developmental stages: early childhood (0-7, imitation and play), elementary (7-14, imagination and artistic expression), and adolescence (14-21, abstract thinking and judgment). Key features include delayed formal academics, emphasis on rhythm and routine, integrated arts curriculum, main lesson blocks, the same class teacher for multiple years, and minimal use of technology. The phenomenological approach to science emphasizes observation over abstraction.",

The approach is built on the image of the child as competent, curious, and full of potential, with 'a hundred languages' for expressing ideas through painting, sculpture, drama, music, and other symbolic representations. Core principles include: children as protagonists in their learning, the environment as the 'third teacher,' teachers as co-learners and documenters, project-based emergent curriculum driven by children's interests, and strong community/parental involvement. Documentation makes learning visible through photographs, transcriptions, and displays. The approach emphasizes collaboration, relationships, and the aesthetic quality of learning spaces.",

Key features include formative assessment after each learning unit, corrective instruction for students who don't initially achieve mastery, and enrichment activities for those who do.

The framework identifies five interrelated principles that consistently appear across effective instruction: Task-Centered (learning organized around real-world problems progressing from simple to complex), Activation (engaging prior knowledge as foundation), Demonstration (showing examples in authentic contexts), Application (practicing with feedback and guidance), and Integration (incorporating new knowledge into life through reflection and discussion).

Techniques include Jigsaw, Think-Pair-Share, Student Teams-Achievement Divisions (STAD), and Team-Game-Tournament.

Based on Jerome Bruner's 1960s research on cognitive development stages, it posits that learners progress through handling real objects (concrete), then drawing pictorial representations like bar models, before working with abstract numbers and symbols. Singapore's Ministry of Education adopted this approach in the 1980s, contributing to Singapore students' top rankings in international assessments like TIMSS and PISA since 1995. The approach focuses on fewer topics in greater depth.",

The theory identifies various achievement emotions including enjoyment, hope, pride, anger, anxiety, shame, hopelessness, and boredom. It predicts that high control and positive value lead to positive emotions, while low control with high value produces anxiety.",

Four mechanisms: goals focus attention, serve as energizers, affect persistence, and activate cognitive strategies.

His 'Mori Reforms' of 1886 included six years of compulsory, co-educational schooling, creation of elite high schools, and establishment of normal schools for teacher training. The system emphasized Neo-Confucian morality and national loyalty in lower schools while allowing intellectual freedom in higher education. Mori founded Japan's first commercial college (predecessor of Hitotsubashi University) and advocated for secular education and women's educational rights.",

Students perform seva (service) while learning sacred texts, philosophy, arts, and practical skills. Education begins with the Upanayana initiation ceremony and continues until around age 25.
